                            It's Only Life After All offers an intimate look into the lives of one of the most iconic folk-rock bands in America 
                            - the Indigo Girls. Blending never-before-seen home movies, raw film archive, and intimate present-day verit&eacute;, It's 
                            Only Life After All is a poignant cinematic reflection on and with Amy Ray and Emily Saliers - aka the Indigo Girls 
                            - and a timely exploration of their profound impact on a community of listeners over the decades.
 
                            Forty years of touring and pouring heart and soul into dozens of hit albums is a massive measure of success for
                             any musician. But Amy and Emily have redefined success and stayed true to themselves despite a steep uphill battle
                              against the status quo. The band have dedicated themselves to understanding and supporting grassroots environmental,
                               Indigenous and social justice activism, never shying away from the tough issues. The love that emanates from the 
                               Indigo Girls' fan community is profound, to say the least. This film celebrates music, songwriting, survival, activism,
                                community and authenticity. It will touch the heart of every fan and convert many more.

                            Starring Mark O'Halloran in the central role as the infamous American sociologist, Laud Humphreys, 
                            Masquerades of Research is based on real life accounts, interviews and experiences of pre-Stonewall 
                            gay life in the United States. Humphreys is the author of a controversial doctoral thesis, Tearoom 
                            Trade: Impersonal Sex in Public Places, which sheds light as never before on the thrilling hidden 
                            world of cottaging.
 
                            Beginning in St. Louis in 1967, the film provides insight into how the civil and social rights movement 
                            created the backdrop for Humphreys' empathetic explorations. Leaping ahead to Los Angeles in 1975, Humphrey
                             is on the cusp of republishing his writing in a radically different post-Stonewall world. The film is a
                               vivid depiction of how social and sexual mores can evolve and devolve around us. With a magnificent 
                               script drawing on real testimony and a truly mesmerising lead performance by O'Halloran, this is 
                               queer history resurrected from the archives and delivered straight to the heart.

                        Red Umbrella Film Festival (RUFF) is organised by current and former sex workers. Our goal is to create 
                        community and conversation around the issues we face in Ireland and internationally. Our four-day festival 
                        from 19-22 October 2023 will include feature films and shorts, panels, workshops, and the kind of after-party
                         only sex workers can throw. We are delighted to be part of GAZE this year and to have the opportunity to 
                         celebrate queer sex workers' lives through film. Where there is sex work, there are queer and trans sex workers. 
                         With our programme at GAZE, we hope to share some of the beauty and complexity of these connections. By 
                         showing sex worker stories, we aim to challenge stigma and shame, fight for our safety and self-determination,
                          and build towards a decriminalised future.

                                    Intersex representation has reached a new milestone with this enthralling documentary by T&uuml;nde Skovr&aacute;n. Focusing on two individuals with

                                    Sharon-Rose is a former South African beauty queen who has experienced an intense version of high-femme culture and 'womanly'
                                    beauty standards from the inside, before discovering she carries an XY chromosome and begins to confront her self-acceptance. 
                                    Her decision to come out publicly causes ripples throughout South African society, and the rest of the world.
                                    Dimakatso navigates their own journey by facing both the contemporary medical establishment and the older traditions of 
                                    shamanistic consultation. The intimacy and frankness of their encounters with partner, family, the job market and medicine 
                                    make for bracing and highly emotive viewing. Ultimately this film offers a model of dignity and pride, and a call for a deeper
                                     understanding. The admiration one is left with for Dimakatso and Sharon-Rose is a testament to the power of cinematic story-telling
                                      towards a greater acceptance. Perfect festival viewing.

                                    Fe&ntilde;a is gay, trans, and just about surviving life in New York City when he must suddenly deal with the 
                                    reappearance of an ex-boyfriend, an ill-timed visit from a well-meaning parent, and the needs of a wayward younger
                                     sister - all in one intense day. A masterpiece of pace, emotion and urban story-telling, Mutt is a rare feature 
                                     that centres a trans man living his life, on and off the rails, flawed but fearless.
 
                                    Leo Mehiel gives the star turn as Fe&ntilde;a and holds the tender heart of this film from start to finish. 
                                    Expect many laughs, sexy thrills, high drama and cringe encounters galore, as director and writer Vuk Lungulov-Klotz 
                                    shows transition as both subtext and subject in a deftly artistic way that only trans filmmakers excel at. A queer 
                                    film festival dream.

                                    Just as soon as the end credits rolled on our first viewing of this heart-breaky feel-good Aussie dramedy, 
                                    we knew it would have to be the closing film for GAZE 2023. It's the summer of 1999, the Millennium Bug is
                                     just around the corner, the future seems weird and uncertain, and two young guys must make an early morning
                                      mercy dash to rescue a hungover girl, stranded in a strange place awaiting rescue on the day of her final 
                                      dance exam.
 
                                    The guys in question are Adam, her sarcastic long-suffering older gay brother, and Kol, her closeted ballroom 
                                    dance partner from an immigrant Serbian family. The pair of young men are thrown together by this hilarious 
                                    unexpected crisis but soon find themselves on a drive that radically alters not only their day but their hearts.
                                     
                                    
                                    The laughs are thick 'n' fast and impeccably written in this gorgeous road movie meets rom com meets teen 
                                    drama, all wrapped up in a beautifully observed nostalgic bundle. At the end of a very long and emotional 
                                    GAZE bank holiday weekend, buckle up and let your feelings run riot. Thanks for the ride…
