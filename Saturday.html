                                aficionado and cinephile? Living in Ireland or just passing through Dublin for the festival? 
                                Come and join us for a relaxed pre-cinema festival social hosted by Festival Director Greg Thorpe
                                 where you can get a coffee, chat about cinema, swap your top tips for the festival, and meet other 
                                 filmmakers. The social will take place at the Light House Cinema and all are welcome. 

                                If you need any kind of assistance to attend, are feeling shy, or would like to know more before you 
                                come along, just email julian@gaze.ie. Looking forward to meeting you all for festival gossip and 
                                networking. Please note there will be a second Filmmaker Social at the same time on Sunday also at

                            Queer relationships can be honest and pure, wholesome and fulfilling. They can also be the total 
                            opposite. Celebrate connections that are complex, messy, petty, sometimes criminal and not always 
                            free in these eight tales of love and lover's revenge.

                                   Ara had always believed she would disappear at twenty-eight years old. 
                                   With that birthday approaching, she pursues the most basic feelings of 
                                   existence in the water, the sun and the sublime. The state of trance is a
                                    wholesome place, alien-like, pervaded by invisible forces. When Ara realizes
                                     where her belief came from, she's propelled to catharsis: does she disappear?

                                   in their mid-thirties. While Mirene and Andr&eacute; struggle with

                                      sexuality, bodily autonomy, reproductive desires, and the ghost of normativity.

                                 doesn't get the response she so desperately wants.

                                    capsule of the raucous, vivacious queer underground scene from which they emerged.

                                    Drawing on a wealth of incredible archival imagery, personal 
                                    testimony and public record, this epic and engrossing documentary 
                                    recounts the long complex histories of LGBTQ+ persecution and resistance
                                     in Brazil. Director, screenwriter and researcher Luis Carlos de Alencar
                                      delves deep to chart the long-held societal prejudices against the LGBTQ 
                                      population in Brazil which came to the fore following the coup of 1964, at
                                       which point queerness came to represent the enemy of the traditional family,
                                        conservative values, morality and good behaviour - a sadly familiar tale. 
                                        The journey from then until now is explosive, terrifying, moving and triumphant -
                                         but never over.
 
                                    The emergence of the Brazilian LGBT movement is a moving and powerful experience and 
                                    the richness of this film's tapestry acts also a call to arms for resistance and resilience 
                                    today, characteristics that have defined Brazil's vast queer communities. As a city with close 
                                    community ties to Brazilian LGBTQIA life, we hope our Dublin audiences will come along with us
                                     on an incredible eye-opening historical journey of discovery and pride. As Alencar writes, 
                                     'Being a filmmaker in Brazil now means dealing not with just one challenge, but with several.
                                      However, it is precisely in this moment of intense crisis that we cannot give up.''

                                    Way back in 2002 at 'The Tenth Dublin Lesbian & Gay Film Festival' we 
                                    were excited to screen a hot new documentary by a young filmmaker named 
                                    Clark Harding. Clark's film The George focused on the regulars of Dublin's
                                     favourite gay bar as a starting point for a wider exploration of the city's
                                      changing queer scene and gay life in the capital. More than twenty years 
                                      later we revisit The George and screen this amazing archive piece in front 
                                      of an audience for the first time since its original outing. Dublin has changed,
                                       gay life has changed, GAZE has changed, have you? 

                                    With fantastic footage of The George, Alternative Miss Ireland, drag shows and 
                                    an already unrecognisable Dublin, you will adore this trip down memory lane via 
                                    South Great George's Street, featuring a cast of Irish queer heroes including Brendan 
                                    Courtney, Panti, Veda, Shirley Temple Bar, and many more blasts from the past.

                                    Queer and particularly trans filmmakers have an affinity for the make-believe, 
                                    from sex dreams to scream queens and all the galaxies in between. What makes 
                                    fantasy, sci-fi and horror so appealing to us? These shorts offer a kaleidoscopic
                                     array of answers. Reimagining a Hawaiian legend revives suppressed histories, a 
                                     bawdy romp in outer space imagines new destinies; digital utopias give new 
                                     perspectives to real-world trans lives; the appearance of ghosts collapses queer
                                      pasts and presents into one. And as all these ideas and more are untangled in

                                Amongst a vulnerable community of transgender sex workers surviving in Mexico City, 
                                Kenya finds herself becoming the mother and the voice for this multiply-marginalised 
                                population. Filmmaker Gisela Delgadillo employs a generous and empowering hands-off 
                                filmmaking technique that places the energy of story-telling into its subject's hands, 
                                with raw and intimate results.
 
                                The tragedy at the centre of this incredible documentary is the murder of a fellow 
                                trans sex worker, Paola, at the hands of one of her clients. The ensuing transformative
                                 fight for justice for Paola encompasses the entire fabric of life as a trans woman sex 
                                 worker in Mexico, igniting purpose, activism, grief and bonding. By the end of the film 
                                 the time spent by the viewer in Kenya's circle and emotional inner world feels both an 
                                 honour and a call to action.

                                Lorenzo secretly yearns to explore his femininity, and according to his religious

                                confront the devil himself.

                                It's a hot and sultry New York summer. Handsome Latinx barber 
                                Quique comes from a super macho Brooklyn world where the men are
                                men and barbershops like his are the heterosexual ground zero. But
                                 when Quique crosses paths with a handsome visiting Irish stranger,
                                  the edges of this world begin to fray for Quique as he becomes tangled
                                   in the complexity of balancing two distinct lives. The result is a sexually
                                    charged odyssey of self-discovery and inescapable attraction.
 
                                This is the long-awaited feature from Dennis Shinners based on the 
                                acclaimed short of the same name, and it is definitely worth the wait.
                                 As director Shinners confesses, Barrio Boy is “a bittersweet love letter
                                  to hookups, breakups, dustups and fuckups.” The charismatic central p

                                  between the male leads makes for a pretty much perfect summer night of
                                   heartfelt homoerotic viewing.

                                controlled substance and Smylex addictions are rising. But one rebellious, unfunny, 
                                transgender clown called Joker is ready to fight the system—just as soon as she legally
                                 changes her name, finally creates a good comedy act, and deals with her toxic boyfriend,
                                  Jared Leto's Joker.

                                Cut short in its 2022 festival run but kept alive by word of mouth and secret screenings, 
                                this feature debut from Emmy-nominated editor and jester visionary Vera Drew brings a 
                                bombastic mix of anti-comedy, animation and transsexual clowns, made with the help of over 
                                100 artists and with zero authorisation from DC Comics. Fun, frenetic and fair use! Last 
                                year we were devastated that our screening of The People's Joker had to be cancelled at the
                                 last moment, but we persevered and are thrilled to present this future cult queer classic in all its glory for 2023.

                                Le Beau Mec ('The Handsome Guy') is a lovingly restored masterpiece of French erotic cinema, 
                                a true diamond in the rough from the history of French gay porn, a film that was once feared 
                                lost and is now available in all its original glory following the discovery of forgotten master
                                 prints. Le Beau Mec was directed by Wallace Potts with a contemporary cinematic restoration 
                                 produced by Gerald Herman who will be on hand to introduce this Irish premiere screening and 
                                 to describe its incredible journey back to the screen.
 
                                Director Potts was the well-known lover of Rudolf Nureyev and the legendary dancer even lent 
                                his choreographic skills to the making of the film. (Yes, the sex is that athletic). The 
                                centrepiece of the movie is 'Le Beau Mec' himself, the dazzlingly handsome Karl Forest, who 
                                roams the city for sexual encounters and never fails to find them. Outdoors, kink, gym sex 
                                and more are on tap to this Parisian hunk and you're invited along for the ride.

                                This short documentary explores the kink and fetish subculture among 
                                Dublin's queer men, as well as the community they've discovered with 
                                their fellow kinksters.
